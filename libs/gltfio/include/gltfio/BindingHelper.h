/**
 * BindingHelper asynchronously uploads vertex buffers and textures to the GPU.
 *
 * For a usage example, see the comment block for AssetLoader.
 *
 * This class holds a map of URL's to data blobs and can therefore be used for multiple assets.
 * However, if desired, clients can immediately destroy the helper after calling loadResources.
 * There is no need to wait for resources to finish uploading because this is done in the
 * the background.
 *
 * The helper must be destroyed on the same thread that calls Renderer::render because it listens to
 * BufferDescriptor callbacks in order to determine when to free CPU-side data blobs.
 *
 * TODO: the GPU upload is asynchronous but the load-from-disk and image decode is not.
